# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Name

InspAI - A React-based web application


## Description

The project is a web application named "InspAI" built using the React JavaScript library. It is a multi-page application with features such as user authentication login and signup pages, a home page, explore page and train page.


### Key Features:

1. **React.js**: The project is primarily built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making the code modular and maintainable.

2. **React Router**: The application uses the `react-router-dom` library for handling navigation and defining routes. This enables the creation of a single-page application with different views based on the route.

3. **CSS Styling**: The project includes CSS stylesheets for styling components and providing a visually appealing user interface. Styles are organized in separate files for global styles, navigation bar styles, and signup page styles.

4. **Image Assets**: Image assets (e.g., person.png, email.png) are stored in the `assets` folder and are used to enhance the visual representation of the application.

### Technologies Used:

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Library for handling navigation in a React application.
- **HTML**: Used to structure the markup of the application's components.
- **CSS**: Styling language used to enhance the visual presentation of the application.

### Additional Notes:

- The project structure follows a modular pattern, separating components into different folders such as `components` and `pages`.
- Each page (e.g., Login, Signup) is created as a React component, and these components are rendered based on the defined routes in the `App.jsx` file.
- Styling is managed using CSS, and images are imported from the `assets` folder.
